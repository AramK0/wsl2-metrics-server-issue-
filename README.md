# üõ†Ô∏è Metrics Server TLS Cert Fix for Minikube on WSL2

### Fix to a problem I faced while setting up Kubernetes on WSL2

If you want to monitor memory and CPU usage of your pods and nodes in Kubernetes, you need **Metrics Server** running.

You can install it using:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/high-availability-1.21+.yaml


This gives us API access to run commands like:

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl top nodes
kubectl top pods

üß® The Issue on WSL2 + Minikube
Sometimes this setup doesn‚Äôt work on WSL2 when using Minikube.

Here's why:

Metrics Server connects securely (HTTPS) to each node‚Äôs kubelet to get CPU/memory usage.

Kubelets use a TLS certificate for encryption.

On Minikube (especially inside WSL2), that cert is self-signed and missing proper IP SANs (Subject Alternative Names).

So Metrics Server refuses to connect because it can‚Äôt verify the certificate.

You‚Äôll see an error in logs like this:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
tls: failed to verify certificate: x509: cannot validate certificate for <IP> because it doesn't contain any IP SANs
To check the logs:

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl logs -n kube-system deployment/metrics-server
‚úÖ The Fix
We fix this by telling Metrics Server to skip cert verification.

Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl edit deployment metrics-server -n kube-system
In the file that opens, scroll down to:

yaml
Copy
Edit
spec:
  containers:
    - name: metrics-server
      args:
Then add this line to the args: section:

yaml
Copy
Edit
--kubelet-insecure-tls
Your final args section might look like:

yaml
Copy
Edit
args:
  - --cert-dir=/tmp
  - --secure-port=10250
  - --kubelet-preferred-address-types=InternalIP,ExternalIP,Hostname
  - --kubelet-use-node-status-port
  - --metric-resolution=15s
  - --kubelet-insecure-tls
Save and exit the editor.

üîÅ Restart and Test
After a few seconds, test it by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl top nodes
kubectl top pods
And check the API service status:

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl get apiservice | grep metrics
You should see it say True now.

üìå Notes
This fix is only for local dev setups like WSL2 or Minikube.

In production, kubelets should use proper TLS certificates with valid SANs ‚Äî this flag shouldn't be used there.
